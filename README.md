<h1> Enhanced Python Calculator with a Storage Feature: A Practical and Versatile Project </h1>
<header>Introduction:</header>
<p>In this project, I extended the functionality of my Python calculator by introducing a novel feature called "Store." This enhancement allowed users to save and retrieve previous calculation results, enhancing the calculator's utility and versatility. By combining my passion for Python programming with creative problem-solving, I aimed to create a powerful and user-friendly tool for everyday arithmetic operations.

</div><div><header>Project Description:</header><p>Building upon the basic calculator, the upgraded version now included a storage mechanism. After each calculation, the result was stored in a history log, allowing users to access and review their past calculations at any time. This feature added convenience and practicality, making the calculator suitable for both quick calculations and more complex tasks.</p></div><div><header>Development Process:</header><ul><li>Integration of Storage Feature: To implement the storage functionality, I utilized Python data structures such as lists or dictionaries to create a history log. After each successful calculation, the result was appended to the log with relevant metadata (e.g., timestamp).</li>
<li>User Interaction: To enable users to access the stored results, I introduced an additional option in the calculator's interface. Users could choose to view their calculation history and select a specific entry for further examination or reuse.</li><li>Persistence: To ensure data persistence, I explored various approaches like saving the history log to a file or using a database. I opted for a simple file-based solution, allowing users to access their history even after closing and reopening the calculator.</li><li>Error Handling and Data Validation: I extended error handling to cover potential issues related to the storage feature, such as empty logs or invalid inputs when accessing past calculations.</li><li>User Interface Improvements: To create an intuitive and user-friendly interface, I added clear instructions for accessing the storage feature and viewing past calculations. Moreover, I integrated commands to manage the storage efficiently, such as clearing the log or exporting it to an external file.</li></ul></div>
